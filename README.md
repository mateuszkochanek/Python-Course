# Python-Course
Solved exercises from Python course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology on Computer Science course.

### List 1
- Basic python exercises, using loops, lists and functions.

### List 2
- I learned how to analyze a file, change file names, find similar file names. I used python to both encode and decode files with RSA/Base64 encodings.

### List 3
- I learned how to use list comprehension, generators. I also used filter, map and lamba expressions.

### List 4
- I learned how decorators and function overload work. I also implemented a tree in exercise 5.

### List 5
- List that introduced me to machine learning. I learned about linear regression. (film recommendations)

### List 6
- I learned about backpropagation and neural networks without using machine learning libraries like keras.

### List 7
- I implemented rethinaNet architecture to detect objects with a model that learned on COCO dataset. I also attempted implementing mobileNet architecture, whilist having a small amount of time to do that, attaining moderate efficiency and results.
